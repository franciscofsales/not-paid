## Client did not pay?


Add opacity to the body tag and decrease it every day until their site completely fades away. Set a due date and customize the number of days you offer them until the website is fully vanished.


```javascript
/* change these variables as you wish */
  var due_date = new Date("2020-01-05"); // Last day for payment
  var days_deadline = 30; // Days given before inaccessible
  var support_email = "youremail@domain.com" // email to add to the notice
/* stop changing here */
```

## Usage
Just load the not-paid.js file in ```<head>``` or after the ```<body>```
